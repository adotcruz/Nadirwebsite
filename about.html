					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<p>
					Hemp has been cultivated globally for over 10,000 years, but that is not the story we have grown to know. It is a food source, medicine, fiber, and remains one of the untapped gems of our global society. Within the USA, the benefits of hemp & cannabis have been wiped from our memories and  replaced with horrific lies used to justify the destruction of communities of color. Despite thousands of years of hemp bettering the human condition, the past 3 generations of Americans have only known the nightmares of marijuana prohibition. In the Age of Information, truth has come to light. Our society is becoming increasingly disillusioned with the obvious lies & hypocrisy. The SMART aims to grow a community on Brown’s campus where members can learn about cannabis with integrity. 
					</p>
					<h1>Problem</h1>
					<p>
					Innovation is arguably the favorite buzzword of every Fortune 500 company. It should be no surprise that for any industry, keeping up with the latest technology is paramount for success. Cannabis has been stalled by draconian laws exacerbated by the failed War On Drugs. Marijuana prohibition has been carried out purposefully to destroy communities of color while the pharmaceutical, alcohol, and tobacco industries who jointly kill millions every year are allowed to indoctrinate themselves through popular culture & media. Hemp needs to be a top priority for scholars of all disciplines. Anyone committed to making a positive, affective change can achieve this through hemp. Plainly, hemp is hands-down a more sustainable crop, a safer medicine, and the next, best potential wealth generator for the restoration of the same communities it has backhandedly been used to destroy. The SMART will no longer let the fear of the unknown rule. In order to dispel the myths of the marijuana boogeyman, the SMART will shed light with real people, real stories, and real opportunities. 
					</p>
					<h1>Background: History in the Making</h1>
					<p>
					Hemp has been grown in the USA since 1619 in the first colonial settlement of Jamestown, Virginia. From America’s inception, hemp had been used as a popular textile in order to make ropes & sails among other supplies, and was listed in the United States Pharmacopeia until 1942. (1942 was also the year the U.S. Military produced the “Hemp For Victory” campaign encouraging farmers’ cultivation of hemp.) The term “marijuana” came to the USA along with the influx of Mexicans following the Mexican-American War. Despite cannabis sativa being utilized in medicines since before the start of 20th century, the US gov’t began its drawn out history of propaganda connoting minority groups & criminality with cannabis highlighted by the American classic, Reefer Madness. Cannabis sativa was cloaked as marijuana, and demonized as a drug that incited violence in Black & Mexican people. By connoting cannabis with criminality, lawmakers were able to enforce harsh legislation that disproportionately attacked communities of color. Nixon’s “Tough On Crime” rhetoric was coded language that lead to a shift in mandatory minimum sentencing for “marijuana possession”, no-knock warrants, and categorizing cannabis as a Schedule I with “no medicinal benefit” (a complete lie). Cannabis went from being feared as a drug that bred violence in minorities, to a substance that was to blame for their “laziness”, now jointly tied with the pacifist movements that countered the Vietnam War effort. Some might say we have been misinformed. But that would assume the US gov’t did not know of the benefits of hemp. Disinformation appropriately acknowledges the convoluted lies levied against those pursuing transparency in cannabis. 
					</p>
					<h1>Current State of Being</h1>
					<p>
					Cannabis is officially MAINSTREAM. In 2016, cannabis policy has been able to gain legislative headway with eight states passed new initiatives. Cannabis is experiencing a boom more expansive than the illustrious dot.com boom of the turn of the century. By 2020, hemp is projected to be a $21 billion dollar industry. It’s only a matter of time that hemp becomes legalized in our American society considering we speak all dialects of green. Pharmaceuticals, alcohol, and cigarette companies have been pouring millions of dollars in lobbying to counter legalization efforts. Hemp is a threat and they know it. Hemp is an all-natural, safer alternative that challenges the status quo, and can be a catalyst for the healing of a nation. The opioid crisis, global warming, and the overall health of our people can be addressed through the versatility of hemp as a fiber, medicine, textile, and food. Still, the growing acceptance of marijuana does not speak to why black people are up to 8x more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession when rates of use are roughy the same across races. Each year our government wastes $3 billion dollars enforcing marijuana laws that have statistically failed in reducing rates of use. With over 50% of Americans for marijuana legalization, there’s no better time to free the plant and heal our nation.
